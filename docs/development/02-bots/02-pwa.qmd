# Progressive Web App

-   Enable this by creating a `manifest.json` and linking to it with a `<link rel="manifest">` tag.
-   Add to home screen on iOS works, but the icon is not displayed.
    -   We needed to add the `apple-touch-icon` link to a PNG file, as it does not accept SVG files.
-   The interface should not be pinch-to-zoomable when added to the home screen.
    -   Add this meta tag to disable pinch to zoom so it doesn't create problems with the theme.
        
        ``` html
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no, viewport-fit=cover"/>
        ```
    - Disabling overscroll worked 

        ```css 
        html {
            overscroll-behavior: none;
        }

        body {
            overflow-y: scroll;
        }
        ```
- The sidebar should display during swipe events.
    - I think this requires some custom mobile framework like [Framework7](https://framework7.io) and would likely be an overoptimisation if ever.
