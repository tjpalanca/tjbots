## Motivation

To explore the [jagged frontier](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/centaurs-and-cyborgs-on-the-jagged) of the capabilities of LLMs, I think the right approach is to be very experimental - try out new use cases and see how we can tweak the various levers (prompts, models, tools, configurations) to solve the goal. 

In order to do that, I think we need to build a test harness for trying out various configurations against different problems, for the following purposes:

- to reduce the time from an idea (hey, maybe I can use an LLM to solve it) to implementing it in code where I can hold it and use it in my day-to-day life, and 
- if there are problems that are currently unsolvable, be able to take advantage of new research and tools developed to re-visit them in the future. 
- make it easy for me to share my findings with others, so that they can benefit from my work and I can learn from them.
