# Pre-commit Hooks

## Setup

The project now includes pre-commit hooks for code quality and consistency:

- **Ruff linter**: Checks for code style issues, import sorting, and various Python best practices
- **Ruff formatter**: Ensures consistent code formatting

## Installation

Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when running `make create` or you can install them manually with `make pre-commit-install`.

## Usage

```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
make pre-commit-run

# Run only linting
make lint

# Run only formatting  
make format

# Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix
```
The hooks will run automatically on every commit, checking only the files you're committing.

## Configuration

- Ruff is configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`.
- Pre-commit configuration is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
