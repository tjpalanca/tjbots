# Vibe Coding

I decided to maximise the use of GitHub Copilot for this project. I want to understand how to practically boost my productivity as a developer and analyst from first principles. 

## Models

- Claude Sonnet 4 has been the most successful for me
    - my observation is that it takes the time to give itself context through looking at docstrings or verifying structures
- Gemini Pro 2.5 has not been great
    - worst was hallucinating packages that don't exist

## Process

- How much do I delegate to the agent?
    - Implementing a feature standalone - haven't tried yet
    - Implementing a small sub-task within the feature - this is the most successful
- `#fetch` to point the model to relevant documentation pages has been useful
