# Pre-commit Hooks

This file documents the pre-commit setup for the tjbots project.

## Setup

The project now includes pre-commit hooks for code quality and consistency:

### Hooks included:
- **Ruff linter**: Checks for code style issues, import sorting, and various Python best practices
- **Ruff formatter**: Ensures consistent code formatting

### Installation

Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when running `make deps` or you can install them manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Usage

**Manual execution:**
```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
make pre-commit-run

# Run only linting
make lint

# Run only formatting  
make format

# Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix
```

**Automatic execution:**
The hooks will run automatically on every commit, checking only the files you're committing.

## Configuration

### Ruff configuration
Ruff is configured in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]` with:
- Line length: 88 characters
- Target Python version: 3.12
- Selected rules: pycodestyle, pyflakes, isort, flake8-bugbear, flake8-comprehensions, pyupgrade

### Pre-commit configuration
The pre-commit configuration is in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and includes:

**Note**: The uv lock hook was excluded due to potential network connectivity issues in some environments. You can manually run `uv lock` when needed.
