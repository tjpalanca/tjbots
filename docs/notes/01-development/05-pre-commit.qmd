# Pre-commit Hooks

This file documents the pre-commit setup for the tjbots project.

## Setup

The project now includes pre-commit hooks for code quality and consistency:

### Hooks included:
- **Ruff linter**: Checks for code style issues, import sorting, and various Python best practices
- **Ruff formatter**: Ensures consistent code formatting
- **uv lock**: Validates and updates the uv lockfile when dependencies change

### Installation

Pre-commit hooks are automatically installed when running `make deps` or you can install them manually:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### Usage

**Manual execution:**
```bash
# Run all hooks on all files
make pre-commit-run

# Run only linting
make lint

# Run only formatting  
make format

# Run linting with auto-fix
make lint-fix
```

**Automatic execution:**
The hooks will run automatically on every commit, checking only the files you're committing.
