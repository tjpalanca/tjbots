# Testing

## Adding smoke tests

- Set up `pytest` to run the tests. 
- Created basic smoke tests to instantiate the app, and to test the config.
- `make test` and `make test-watch` allow for iterating on tests easily. 
- [ ] Add smoke tests to actually run the app within the devcontainer 
    - Shiny developers recommend using `playwright` to test the actual app. 
    - They provide controllers to abstract over the UI interactions.
    - There's a bit of a challenge running this in a devcontainer.
- [ ] Add smoke tests to add the Shiny Server implementation and test that as well
