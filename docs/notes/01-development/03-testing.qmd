# Testing

We use pytest for testing and have set up automated CI/CD to catch issues early. Tests mirror the source code structure, making it easy to find what you're looking for.

## Running Tests

Use the convenient Makefile commands:

```bash
make test        # Run all tests
make test-watch  # Run in watch mode (stops on first failure)
```

## Test Utilities

We have a `MOCK_ENV` in `test_utils.py` with fake API keys so you don't need real ones for testing:

```python
@patch.dict(os.environ, MOCK_ENV)
def test_something(self):
    # Your test here - config will use mock keys
```

This keeps tests isolated and means anyone can run them without setting up API accounts.

## Continuous Integration

Tests run automatically on GitHub Actions when you make a pull request or merge to main.
