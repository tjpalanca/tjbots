# Vibe Coding

I decided to maximise the use of GitHub Copilot for this project. I want to understand how to practically boost my productivity as a developer and analyst from first principles. 

## Models

- Claude Sonnet 4 has been the most successful for me
    - my observation is that it takes the time to give itself context through looking at docstrings or verifying structures
- Gemini Pro 2.5 has not been great
    - worst was hallucinating packages that don't exist

## Process

- How much do I delegate to the agent?
    - Implementing a feature standalone - haven't tried yet
    - Implementing a small sub-task within the feature - this is the most successful
- `#fetch` to point the model to relevant documentation pages has been useful

## Claude Code

- I also added claude code since I have the subscription.
- It's oddly charming? The fact that it's in my terminal is quite cute and the VS code integration works well.
- One where Copilot was better - I was asking about something in my github actions workflow and copilot fetched that, whereas claude code could not interact with the extensions in VS Code. 

# Copilot Coding Agent

- A simple task like adding uv pre-commit hooks was good but it still kind of did too much. 
- GitHub has some docs about giving it even more context and setting up its environment. I struggled with Codex.
