# GitHub Copilot Agents 

The workflow is similar to how you would interact with a human developer (jokes, banter, and off-topic Slack conversations aside):

1. Create an issue, this should contain a lot more context because that's the prompt to the agent essentially.
2. Assign Copilot the issue and they will raise the pull request.
3. Make comments, do reviews, and then eventually get the PR merged. You can even add in some commits of your own.
