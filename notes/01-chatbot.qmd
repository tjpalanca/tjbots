## Motivation

I want to create a test harness that allows me to quickly test our various levers, including:

- LLM model providers (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) and models (e.g. GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini)
- System and user prompts
- Tools (e.g. web search, code execution, memory, etc.)
- Configuration (e.g. chain-of-thought)

The sources of these configurations can come from:

- problems I want to solve
- articles I read about LLMs that give me ideas
